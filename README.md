# MHWilds-Save-Backup
This is a very rudimentary script, as I am very new to coding, that will allow you to plug in a couple of file paths and back up your save data at the push of a button.

All you need to do is replace the text in the script that tells you to replace it with your file path locations (you can easily get your file path location by right clicking in the bar at the top of the file explorer and selecting "copy address as text" 

Here's what it will look like (Keep in mind that your file path may differ from the example) -- C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\104055473\2246340\remote\win64_save

Once that's done you can run it simply by double clicking the script file or right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell"

If you're struggling to find your file paths please follow along with this guide: https://youtu.be/L6ohW4Ogx2s
